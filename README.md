# Astronomy
Converting my astronomy for calculator book routines into Python code.

This is a total work in progress.  Right now, I'm just dinking around, making sure I can code up the routines in question.
As I progress, I'll put more structure to things: add some functions, streamline the code, etc.  
But for now, don't critique it too hard.  ;)
